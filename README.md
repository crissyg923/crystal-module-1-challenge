# crystal-module-1-challenge

## Project Description
 
This project was completed to fulfill **Horiseon’s** goal of ensuring their website is following accessibility standards as well as making sure they are optimized for search engines.  Through completing this refactoring assignment, it gave me an opportunity to experiment with code, learn how to make a site more accessible and how to clean up the code for easier site maintenance.  I was able to:

* Add a title and description to make the site appear higher in search engines 

* Add alt text to images, making it accessible to disabled individuals as well as creating a placeholder in the event that the images do not load

* Fix the bug in the code causing the “SEO” link in the header to not work

* Add comments to the code making for easier viewing and future maintenance of the site

In working with Horiseon’s site, I was motivated by my belief that everyone should have access to technology, regardless of disability.  Making sure that your website is accessible to everyone should always be a priority.  As an avid “google searcher”, I also understand that someone is more likely click on one of the first links they see and it is much better when you can view text for each search result that previews what will be on the webpage when you click it.

### Installation

Installing this project requires you to clone  the **crystal-first-module-challenge**  repository to your local computer.  You can then edit the code and push your changes to the repo.   The steps involved are:

* Hit the **code** button in the repository’s homepage.

* Clone the HTTPS code.

* Head to your machine’s local Terminal (for Mac) or Gitbash (for Windows).

Command into the directory where you want to park the repo.  It’s best practice to give the directory the same name as the repo.  Type the following command:

 git clone (get clone link)
Cd crystal-first-module-challenge

Now you can edit the files in the Markup Text Editor of your choice.

When you are done, save your changes and push them to the repo using the following commands:

git status (just to make sure you are still in the git repo)
git add -A
git commit -m “brief text description of changes”
git push origin main
